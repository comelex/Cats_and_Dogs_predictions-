🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Prediction

Welcome to the Cat and Dog Prediction project! This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is implemented in Python with the help of libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.


Image classification is a common task in the field of computer vision. This project focuses on building a CNN model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, train a neural network, and evaluate its performance.
